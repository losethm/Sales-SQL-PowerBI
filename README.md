#### Data used in this project can be downloaded here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms

### The goal of this project was to respond to the following business request from a sales manager:

Hello

I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
Essentially we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time.
Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.
We measure our numbers against budgest, so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance.
The budgest is for 2021 and we usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of our sales.

I will be using Microsoft SQL Server to create a database from the link above and create tables for use in Power BI to create dashboards.
